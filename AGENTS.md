# Automation foundation

Bootstrap, performance, and CI/CD discipline for code-modifying work. Compose this block into
code-oriented modes ahead of the TDD contract. This is the de-interwoven source of the original
operating contract's automation sections (Definitions + bootstrap + performance + CI/CD).

## Definitions

- **Production code**: application, library, service, or runtime code that changes shipped system behavior.
- **Current scope**: the repo's currently real behavior, boundaries, build surfaces, packaging/release surfaces, and applicable validation needs. Do not invent future scope.
- **Local CI/CD configuration**: the local developer validation suite, the local release-readiness validation suite, and the canonical shared rules/scripts/configuration that drive them.
- **Automation foundation**: all of the following for the current scope:
  1. one canonical source of gates, rules, and failure conditions
  1. a local developer validation suite
  1. a local release-readiness validation suite
  1. changed-file / affected-target execution, or a safe documented fallback
  1. deterministic caching, or a safe documented deterministic no-cache fallback
  1. safe parallel execution where applicable
  1. a matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow
  1. verified local ↔ GitHub parity for the current scope
- Tests, validation scripts, CI/CD config, and bootstrap automation may be created before production code when required by this contract.


## Mandatory minimal automation bootstrap

Before writing any production test or any production code, you MUST establish and validate a **minimal automation foundation** for the current scope.

This bootstrap is mandatory.

It is not realistic to have all CI/CD perfect at the start. Therefore:

- perfection is **not** required before RED
- a minimal, deterministic, safe, working automation foundation **is** required before RED
- that foundation must pass for the current scope
- that foundation must evolve in lockstep as production tests, production code, boundaries, build surfaces, packaging, and release concerns evolve
- no new production capability may permanently outrun the automation required to validate it safely

### Bootstrap requirements

Before RED begins, create and validate the currently applicable versions of:

- a local developer validation suite for fast feedback
- a local release-readiness validation suite sized to the current scope
- changed-file / affected-target execution, or an explicitly documented safe fallback
- deterministic caching, or an explicitly documented deterministic no-cache fallback
- safe parallel execution where applicable
- a matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow
- one canonical source of format, lint, type, structure, test, cache, affected-target, build, release, and failure rules

These may begin minimal, but they MUST exist before any production tests are written, and they MUST evolve with the system.

### Bootstrap objectives

For the current scope, automation MUST provide:

- immediate feedback
- localized failures
- incremental execution where correctness permits
- avoidance of re-running unaffected work where correctness permits
- deterministic gates
- local and GitHub results that match as closely as environments allow
- minimal, safe, reproducible, fast execution

### Local developer validation suite

Before any production tests are written, a minimal local developer validation suite MUST exist and include every cheap, deterministic, currently applicable developer-feedback gate, including where applicable:

- format validation
- linting
- type checking
- unit and integration test execution
- build verification
- structure-rule enforcement
- changed-file / impacted-target filtering
- fast-fail behavior
- watch mode

It MUST be optimized for feedback:

- sub-second to a few seconds for small edits when feasible
- incremental by default
- parallel where safe
- no unnecessary full-repo scans
- no unnecessary full test runs
- no nondeterministic steps

As production tests and production code evolve, this suite MUST evolve too.

### Local release-readiness validation suite

Before any production tests are written, an initial local release-readiness validation suite MUST also exist.

It validates release and deployment readiness for the **current known release surface** and expands as the system evolves. Where applicable, it includes:

- full-repo validation
- artifact buildability
- packaging correctness
- configuration validation
- environment contract validation
- deployment preflight checks
- rollback readiness validation

It MUST be deterministic and reproducible, must not depend on hidden machine state, may be slower than the developer suite, and must be runnable on demand and before release/promotion.

### Canonical gate definition

All gates MUST be defined once and reused wherever technically possible.

The canonical source MUST govern:

- format rules
- lint rules
- type rules
- structural limits
- test policies
- cache behavior
- affected-target logic
- build validation rules
- release validation rules
- failure conditions

Local and GitHub automation must consume or derive from the same canonical source. No duplicated logic that can drift unless technically unavoidable; any unavoidable duplication must be documented and minimized.

Every new gate or rule change MUST be added to the canonical source first.

### Matching GitHub Agentic Workflow

Before any production tests are written, you MUST create a minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow that mirrors the current local validation model as closely as possible.

It MUST:

- mirror current local gates
- preserve the same pass/fail semantics for equivalent inputs
- run checks in parallel where possible
- fast-fail on critical failures where supported
- avoid re-running unaffected work where correctness permits
- remain deterministic
- use minimal permissions
- isolate agent analysis from write operations

It may start minimal, but it MUST evolve with the system.

### GitHub Agentic Workflow safety model

The GitHub workflow MUST ensure:

- agent execution is isolated
- agent execution is read-only by default
- proposed actions are emitted as structured outputs or artifacts
- any write is performed only by a separate, explicitly scoped, guarded job
- suspicious, malformed, or unsafe outputs fail the workflow
- secrets are not exposed to the agent unless strictly required for a narrowly scoped step
- network access is minimized and explicitly controlled where possible

The agent may analyze, reason, and propose. It must not directly mutate the repository, create uncontrolled side effects, or bypass guarded write steps.

### Local ↔ GitHub parity

For every local gate that exists, there MUST be a corresponding GitHub gate unless the gate is inherently local-only.

Parity includes, where applicable:

- formatter behavior
- linter behavior
- type-checker behavior
- structure-rule behavior
- test selection behavior
- full-suite behavior
- build verification behavior
- release-readiness behavior
- failure semantics
- cache semantics where feasible

Any divergence is a defect unless explicitly unavoidable due to environment differences. Any unavoidable divergence MUST be documented and minimized.

### Bootstrap order

Before writing production tests:

1. define canonical rules and failure conditions for the current scope
1. set up the local developer validation suite
1. set up the local release-readiness validation suite
1. set up affected-target execution or a safe documented fallback
1. set up deterministic caching or a safe deterministic no-cache fallback
1. set up safe parallel execution
1. set up the matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow
1. verify local ↔ GitHub parity for the current scope
1. only then begin RED

### Bootstrap verification

RED may begin only when, for the current scope:

- the automation foundation exists
- the local developer suite passes
- the local release-readiness suite passes
- changed-file / affected-target execution works, or the documented safe fallback works
- full validation works
- caches work where enabled, or deterministic no-cache behavior is confirmed where caching is deferred
- enabled parallel execution works correctly
- the GitHub workflow reflects the currently implemented gates and failure conditions
- local and GitHub outcomes match for equivalent inputs as closely as environments allow

### Ongoing evolution

Bootstrap is not a one-time event.

A minimal local CI/CD configuration and matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow MUST exist before any production tests are written, and they MUST evolve as production tests and production code evolve.

## Performance mandate

All engineering activity MUST maximize speed without sacrificing determinism, safety, correctness, or TDD constraints.

**Core principle:** any unnecessary slowdown is a defect.

If two approaches are equally correct, choose the faster one.

### Speed requirements

Automation, builds, tests, linting, type checking, feedback loops, local validation, release-readiness validation, and GitHub workflows MUST be as fast as possible while remaining correct and deterministic.

Required properties:

- incrementality where possible
- safe parallelism where possible
- determinism and cacheability where possible
- no hidden global state that breaks caching or parallelism
- no blocking of unrelated work without cause
- no duplicated automation logic that can be shared
- local feedback in sub-second to a few seconds for small edits when feasible
- CI feedback accelerated via parallelism, impact analysis, and fast-fail

Specific expectations:

- builds: incremental by default, avoid full rebuilds unless necessary, use caching, minimize I/O/bundling/transformations
- tests: hermetic, isolated, parallel where safe, support impact analysis where correct, avoid slow setup/teardown and unnecessary integration scope in unit tests
- lint/typecheck: incremental and watch mode where supported, process only changed or affected inputs when correct, avoid redundant passes, parallelize where supported

### Prohibited performance anti-patterns

- starting production TDD before the current-scope automation foundation exists
- running the full test suite on every change when not required for correctness
- global cache invalidation without cause
- sequential execution where safe parallelism is possible
- recomputing unchanged artifacts
- tests depending on shared mutable state
- long-running setup inside individual tests
- reprocessing unchanged inputs without cause
- CI pipelines serializing independent jobs
- local and GitHub pipelines drifting in behavior
- remote workflows re-running work that can be safely skipped based on trusted prior validation and equivalent inputs

### Required optimization strategies

- test impact analysis
- incremental compilation and type checking
- persistent caching across runs
- parallel execution for tests, linting, type checking, builds, and validation jobs where safe
- watch mode where applicable
- deterministic precomputation and memoization
- fast-fail mechanisms
- canonical shared gate definitions
- local-first validation before remote execution

### Enforcement

- performance regressions are failures
- speed improvements are part of REFACTOR
- any noticeable slowdown must be investigated and resolved
- automation parity regressions are failures


## Automation and CI/CD constraints

- A minimal local developer validation suite is mandatory before any production tests.
- An initial local release-readiness validation suite is mandatory before any production tests.
- A matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow is mandatory before any production tests.
- All three must remain aligned for the current scope.
- All three must evolve as production tests and production code evolve.
- Any gate change MUST update the canonical source first.
- No local-only or GitHub-only standards unless explicitly justified and documented.
- Agent execution has no write privileges by default.
- No unguarded remote side effects.
- No unnecessary secret exposure to agent execution.
- No bypass of guarded write jobs.


## Required working style

When implementing:

- first determine whether the automation foundation exists and passes for the current scope; if not, work only on bootstrap
- establish a minimal local CI/CD configuration and matching minimal GitHub Agentic Workflow before any production tests
- do not wait for a perfect final CI/CD design; establish the smallest deterministic, safe, working foundation that covers the current scope
- evolve local CI/CD and the GitHub workflow as tests and code evolve
- prefer minimal explicit scripts/configuration over large opaque frameworks
- reuse one canonical source of truth for local and GitHub gates wherever possible
- keep changes narrowly scoped and reversible
- validate the smallest correct scope first, then expand only as needed
- state exactly which files, gates, and targets you inspected or changed
- never claim parity, determinism, cache correctness, test passing, or build validity unless you actually verified it
- if a shortcut would violate bootstrap, TDD order, parity, safety, determinism, structure, or performance constraints, refuse it and propose the next compliant step
- optimize for maintainable human understanding, not maximum autonomous output
- build less, but build it clearly, observably, and correctly

If you violate any constraint in this contract, including bootstrap, parity, safety, structure, determinism, or performance constraints, the output is incorrect.

<!-- block: core/blocks/coding.md -->

You must operate strictly in a TDD-first RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for all code changes. No production code may be written unless it is directly driven by a failing test. All dependencies must be treated as externally provided capabilities, declared at the boundary and supplied at runtime.

---

## 1. RED (Failing Test Required)

- Begin every unit of work by writing a failing test that reflects a real user-facing behavior, contract, or interface.
- Tests must validate externally observable outcomes only (inputs, outputs, side effects, API responses, UI states).
- Tests must interact only with public interfaces or system boundaries.
- Dependencies must be treated as abstract capabilities (e.g., HTTP client, database, filesystem, clock) and supplied explicitly to the system under test.
- You are strictly prohibited from:

  - Testing private/internal functions, classes, or modules
  - Asserting on implementation details (method calls, internal state, structure)
  - Writing tests that would pass even if the underlying implementation were replaced
  - Instantiating real external systems directly inside tests

---

## 2. GREEN (Minimal Implementation)

- Write the smallest possible amount of code required to make the failing test pass.
- Do not preemptively generalize or optimize.
- Do not add functionality beyond what is required by the current failing test.
- All dependencies must be consumed via declared interfaces/capabilities, not constructed inline.
- Business logic must remain unaware of concrete implementations.

---

## 3. REFACTOR (Safe Improvement)

- Refactor only after tests are passing.
- You may improve structure, readability, and maintainability only if all tests remain green.
- Refactoring must not change externally observable behavior.
- You may extract and reorganize dependency wiring into composition layers, but must not leak implementation details into business logic.

---

## 4. Dependency & Test Model (Strict)

- All external systems (network, filesystem, database, time, third-party APIs) must be represented as abstract capabilities.
- The system must declare its required capabilities explicitly.
- Concrete implementations must be provided externally at the composition/runtime boundary.
- Tests must provide controlled, deterministic implementations of these capabilities.
- Tests must not depend on real external systems or implicit global state.
- Tests must validate behavior through capability interactions and observable outcomes only.

---

## 5. Test Constraints (Strict)

- All tests must:

  - Represent user intent or system contracts
  - Be written at the boundary of the system (API layer, CLI interface, UI, or public service interfaces)
  - Interact with the system through declared capabilities only
- If a test requires knowledge of internal implementation to exist, it is invalid and must not be written.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rules

- No code without a prior failing test.
- No passing tests that do not reflect real user behavior.
- No skipping RED or combining phases.
- No constructing dependencies inside business logic.
- All dependencies must be supplied from the outside.
- If uncertain whether a test is valid, default to higher-level, user-observable behavior.

---

## 7. Definition of Done

A task is only complete when:

- All tests were written first (RED)
- All tests pass (GREEN)
- Code has been safely improved (REFACTOR)
- Dependencies are declared, not constructed
- Concrete implementations are provided only at the boundary
- Tests verify real-world usage through observable behavior and controlled capability implementations

If you violate any of these constraints, the output is considered incorrect.

---

## 8. Code Structure Constraints (Strict, Non-Negotiable)

### 8.0 Scope

- Sections 8.1 to 8.7 apply to code only: Python and shell source under `mcp_zammad/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/`.
- They do not apply to documentation, generated files, or configuration. This includes Markdown (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `.claude/`), YAML, TOML, and JSON files. `.rumdl.toml` sets the Markdown policy.
- The limits apply to new constructs and to constructs that a change modifies. A change does not have to refactor constructs that it does not touch.
- Docstring and comment changes do not make a construct a changed construct.
- These files were over the 200-line limit on 2026-09-30. They are exempt from section 8.3 until they are refactored. New and changed constructs in them must still obey sections 8.1 and 8.2.
  - `mcp_zammad/server.py`, `mcp_zammad/client.py`, `mcp_zammad/models.py`
  - `tests/test_server.py`, `tests/test_client_methods.py`, `tests/test_kb_readonly.py`, `tests/test_client.py`, `tests/test_models.py`, `tests/integration/test_http_transport.py`
  - `scripts/uv/coverage-report.py`, `scripts/uv/test-zammad.py`, `scripts/uv/security-scan.py`, `scripts/uv/validate-env.py`

### 8.1 Maximum Nesting Depth (≤ 3)

- All production code MUST have a maximum nesting depth of 3.
- Nesting includes: if, else, switch, loops, closures, callbacks, and scoped blocks.
- Each new block increases depth by 1.
- Depth MUST be minimized using:

  - Guard clauses / early returns
  - Function extraction
  - Declarative transformations (map, filter, reduce) instead of nested loops
- Tests:

  - Nesting depth is measured relative to the test declaration boundary (test, it, etc.).
  - Setup, execution, and assertions within that scope must still not exceed depth 3.

### 8.2 Maximum Construct Size (≤ 30 LOC)

- A “construct” is any language-level type or unit defined within a file, NOT the entire file.

- Every construct MUST be ≤ 30 lines of executable code.

- Applies to:

  - Functions / methods
  - Classes
  - Interfaces / types
  - Structs / protocols
  - Enums, modules, and any other declared types

- Rules:

  - Blank lines and comments count
  - Inline closures/lambdas count toward the parent construct

- If exceeded, MUST refactor via:

  - Function decomposition
  - Composition
  - Module extraction

### 8.3 Maximum File Size (≤ 200 LOC)

- Every file MUST be ≤ 200 lines of code total.

- This includes:

  - All constructs
  - Imports
  - Comments
  - Blank lines

- If exceeded, MUST refactor via:

  - Splitting into multiple files
  - Extracting modules
  - Isolating responsibilities per file

### 8.4 Single Responsibility Enforcement

- Each construct MUST have one clearly defined responsibility.
- Mixed concerns within a single construct are prohibited.
- Violations MUST be split into smaller units.

### 8.5 Prohibited Patterns

- Nesting depth > 3 under any circumstance
- Multi-responsibility ("god") constructs
- Hidden complexity via deeply nested inline closures
- Large test blocks obscuring behavior
- Implicit control flow that increases cognitive depth

### 8.6 Required Refactoring Strategies

- Flatten control flow aggressively
- Prefer pure functions
- Replace imperative nesting with declarative pipelines
- Extract intermediate variables for clarity
- Co-locate logic with explicit boundaries

### 8.7 Enforcement

- These are hard constraints, not guidelines
- Any violation within the scope of section 8.0 MUST be resolved immediately
- No exceptions for "readability" or "performance" without restructuring
- Code that violates these constraints is considered invalid and incomplete

# Code-change stance

Portable stance for code-modifying work. Compose into code-oriented modes (e.g. tdd-coding); not
part of the neutral global baseline.

## Fix forward — no backwards-compatibility shims

When removing, deprecating, or migrating code, delete the deprecated path immediately rather than
leaving compatibility shims, dead branches, or "old + new" duals. The repository history is the
back-compat mechanism; the working tree should carry only the current design.

## Loud errors over graceful failures

Prefer detailed, loud failures over silent or graceful degradation. Surface the problem — with
enough context to act on — so it is fixed fast rather than masked. Do not swallow errors, default
away missing state, or continue past an unexpected condition to keep things "working."

<!-- block: core/blocks/python.md -->

# Python

Portable Python conventions. Compose into the AGENTS.md of Python repos (or a future Python mode);
not part of the neutral global baseline.

## Interpreter

Never invoke `python` or `python3` directly. Always go through `uv` (`uv run`, `uv run --script`, …).

## Standalone / reusable scripts

Use PEP 723 inline script metadata for self-contained, portable execution:

- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script --quiet`, followed by a `# /// script` block declaring
  `requires-python` and `dependencies`.
- Make the file executable (`chmod +x`) before use.

Module docstring requirements:

- One-line summary in imperative mood (ends with a period).
- `Usage:` section with concrete invocation examples.
- Document when to use AND when NOT to use (for AI-agent clarity).
- `Args:` / `Options:` with types and example values where helpful.
- Optional `Features:` and `Notes:` sections for capabilities and caveats.

## Functions, methods, classes

Use Google-style docstrings:

- One-line summary in imperative mood (ends with a period).
- `Args:` for every parameter (even when type-annotated). Prefix optional params with `Optional.`.
- `Returns:` for any non-`None` return — describe the value and possible states.
- `Raises:` for every exception the caller should expect.
- Extended description only when the WHY/WHEN is non-obvious from the signature; do not restate the
  type annotation.
- `Examples:` (doctest format) for non-obvious usage.

# Zammad MCP repository layer

Repository-specific guidance for `basher83/Zammad-MCP`. This layer supplements the portable `tdd-python` contract; keep generic Python and TDD rules in the mode rather than duplicating them here.

## Purpose and boundaries

- This project is an unofficial FastMCP server for the Zammad ticket API.
- The installed command is `mcp-zammad`, backed by `mcp_zammad.__main__:main`.
- `mcp_zammad/server.py` owns FastMCP registration and server lifecycle; `client.py` wraps Zammad API access; `models.py` holds Pydantic request and response models; `config.py` validates transport configuration and builds the optional OAuth provider (`TransportConfig`, `AuthConfig`, `OAuthProxy`).
- External systems are Zammad HTTP, environment and secret-file configuration, and MCP transports. Unit tests must use controlled doubles rather than real Zammad credentials or network access. HTTP integration tests use a fake Zammad server and a subprocess boundary.

## Tooling and validation

- Use `uv` for Python dependency and command execution. Use `mise run setup` for repository setup.
- `mise run validate` runs the fast non-mutating developer gates (`./scripts/validate.sh dev`: format check, lint, types, affected tests). `mise run validate-release` runs the release gates (`./scripts/validate.sh release`: the same lint gates, the full coverage suite, and a package build). The CI `validate` job runs the release gates.
- Cheap non-mutating checks are `uv run ruff format --check mcp_zammad tests`, `uv run ruff check mcp_zammad tests`, `uv run mypy mcp_zammad`, and focused `uv run pytest <path>`.
- `./scripts/quality-check.sh` is mutating: it formats code, applies Ruff fixes, writes security and coverage reports, and runs the full suite with an 86% coverage floor. Do not use it when a read-only validation was requested.
- `mise run pre-commit-run` invokes `prek run --all-files`; configured hooks may modify files.
- Use `mise run changelog` for unreleased changelog updates and `mise run changelog-bump <version>` when preparing a release. Do not hand-edit released changelog sections.

## Version pins and gates

`pyproject.toml` declares Python `>=3.10,<3.14`, and the test workflow matrix covers Python 3.10 to 3.13. `mise.toml` is the source of truth for the Python and uv versions. uv and the `setup-python` step in the security workflow read `.python-version` and never read `mise.toml`, and mise does not read `.python-version` unless `idiomatic_version_file_enable_tools` includes `python`. `scripts/validate.sh` therefore checks that `.python-version`, the `setup-uv` workflow steps, and the `uv-pre-commit` hook match `mise.toml`, and fails when they differ. Renovate groups these pins so that one PR updates them together. The check compares the version in the `uv-pre-commit` comment, not the commit SHA, so keep the comment accurate when you change the SHA. Coverage uses one 86% floor in `pyproject.toml`. `mise run markdown-lint` and pre-commit both run Rumdl with `.rumdl.toml`.

## Git

- Write commit messages in Conventional Commits format (`type(scope): summary`). `cliff.toml` builds the changelog from them and drops commits that do not match.
- Do not bypass the pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`. Fix the failure and commit again.
- Ask before you push, force-push, rewrite published history, or delete a remote branch.

## FastMCP contract

- Import `FastMCP` from `fastmcp`, not `mcp.server.fastmcp`.
- Supported transports are `stdio` and `http`. Stdio is the default. For HTTP, `MCP_PORT` defaults to `8000` and `MCP_HOST` to `127.0.0.1`; `MCP_SSL_CERTFILE`/`MCP_SSL_KEYFILE` enable HTTPS.
- Pass HTTP host and port to `mcp.run(transport="http", host=..., port=...)`; do not pass them to `FastMCP()`.
- Keep tool annotations accurate: distinguish read-only, write, idempotent-write, and destructive operations.
- MCP clients see only the first docstring paragraphs of a tool, up to its `Args:` or `Parameters:` section. FastMCP drops the rest. Without a parameter section, clients see the whole docstring. Put what an agent needs there: when to use the tool, what to use instead, and requirements or errors. `tests/test_tool_descriptions.py` checks this text through the MCP boundary.
- Register tools, resources, and prompts through the `ZammadMCPServer` setup methods. Test observable MCP behavior through public FastMCP or process boundaries; do not add new assertions against private registries.

## Configuration and security invariants

- `ZAMMAD_URL` is required and must include the API path expected by the client.
- Authentication supports HTTP token, OAuth2 token, or username/password. Secret-file variants are supported for token and password inputs; see `.env.example` and `mcp_zammad/client.py`.
- Inbound OAuth (HTTP transport only) proxies to Zammad's built-in Doorkeeper provider when `MCP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `MCP_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `MCP_AUTH_BASE_URL` are set. `get_client()` then builds a per-request `ZammadClient` from the authenticated user's bearer token, and static Zammad credentials are not required.
- TLS verification is enabled by default. `ZAMMAD_INSECURE` is an explicit escape hatch for trusted self-signed environments and must not become a silent default.
- Preserve URL validation, base64 validation, filename path/null-byte stripping, and HTML escaping on the model fields that currently apply it. Do not describe these as comprehensive SSRF or XSS prevention without stronger evidence.
- Never place real Zammad credentials in tests, fixtures, logs, examples, or committed environment files.
