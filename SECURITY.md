## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Private Disclosure

**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use one of these methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/basher83/Zammad-MCP/security/advisories/new) via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Email**: For urgent security matters, contact repository maintainers directly
- **Encrypted Email**: For sensitive reports, use GPG encryption (key available on request)

### 2. What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., SSRF, XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)
- **Affected Components**: Full paths of source files and functions
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Detailed step-by-step instructions
  2. Include code samples or scripts if applicable
  3. Expected vs actual behavior
- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Potential attack scenarios
  - Affected users or data
- **Proof of Concept**: Include PoC code if available
- **Suggested Fix**: Your recommended mitigation (optional)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Token Security

- **Use OAuth authentication** for multi-user deployments — users authenticate through Zammad's login page and no static tokens are stored server-side (see [Auth Provider Configuration](README.md#auth-provider-configuration-optional))
- **Use API tokens instead of username/password** for single-user / service account setups
- **Store tokens securely** using environment variables or secure credential storage
- **Rotate tokens regularly** (recommended: every 90 days)
- **Limit token scope** to minimum required permissions
- **Never commit tokens** to version control

#### Environment Configuration

```bash
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
export ZAMMAD_HTTP_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# ❌ Bad: Hard-coded in configuration files
ZAMMAD_HTTP_TOKEN=abc123token
```

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zammad": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/basher83/zammad-mcp.git", "mcp-zammad"],
      "env": {
        "ZAMMAD_URL": "https://your-instance.zammad.com/api/v1",
        "ZAMMAD_HTTP_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Notes:**

- Ensure Claude Desktop configuration files have restricted permissions
- Use different tokens for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Monitor token usage in Zammad's admin interface

#### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS in production** - the client permits `http://` for development and trusted internal environments
- **Keep TLS verification enabled** - `ZAMMAD_INSECURE=true` disables TLS certificate verification for the
  upstream Zammad connection. The client verifies TLS certificates by default. Set `ZAMMAD_INSECURE` only for trusted
  self-signed or internal certificate chains.
- **Protect the HTTP transport listener** - the server has no inbound MCP client authentication. `ZAMMAD_*`
  credentials authenticate the server to Zammad only. `MCP_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Keep that default, or
  put the listener behind an authenticated reverse proxy. See the
  [HTTP Transport Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/http-transport.md#1-authentication).
- **Network isolation** - run in isolated environments when possible
- **Firewall rules** - restrict outbound connections to necessary endpoints only

### For Developers

#### Secure Development

- **Input validation** - validate all user inputs and API responses
- **Error handling** - don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging** - sanitize logs to prevent credential leakage
- **Dependencies** - keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

#### Code Security Guidelines

```python
# ✅ Good: Sanitized logging
logger.info(f"Request to {url.split('?')[0]}")  # Remove query parameters

# ❌ Bad: Exposing credentials
logger.debug(f"Full request: {url}")  # May contain tokens in URL
```

#### Testing Security

- Test with minimal permissions
- Use separate test instances
- Never use production credentials in tests
- Implement security tests in CI/CD pipeline

## Data Handling

### Customer Data Protection

- **Data minimization** - only access necessary ticket/user data
- **Temporary storage** - avoid storing customer data locally
- **Memory management** - clear sensitive data from memory when possible
- **Compliance** - follow GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations

### API Response Handling

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear sensitive data
response_data = api_call()
process_data(response_data)
del response_data  # Clear from memory

# ✅ Good: Limit data exposure
filtered_data = {k: v for k, v in data.items()
                if k not in ['password', 'token', 'secret']}
```

### MCP Server Audit Logging

The server can emit an opt-in audit trail (`ZAMMAD_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true`) as JSON Lines to
stderr, a file, or syslog. It records tool-call outcomes, connection outcomes, and URL security
checks for forensic review. It is an operator-controlled aid, not a compliance certification:

- Records contain no tool arguments, Zammad responses, credentials, or full URLs; failures are
  logged by exception type only, and sensitive-looking `details` keys are redacted.
- Records are written locally only. Retention, rotation, and access control for file and syslog
  destinations are the operator's responsibility; treat the audit file as sensitive metadata.
- Audit output never uses stdout, so it cannot corrupt the stdio transport.

## Zammad Instance Security

### Instance Configuration

- Keep Zammad updated to the latest version
- Use strong authentication methods
- Enable audit logging
- Configure proper user permissions
- Regular security audits

### API Token Management

- Create dedicated tokens for MCP integration
- Use descriptive token names (e.g., "MCP-Server-Production")
- Regularly review and rotate tokens
- Monitor token usage in Zammad logs
- Revoke unused or compromised tokens immediately

### Permission Guidelines

Recommended minimum permissions for MCP tokens:

- `ticket.agent` - For ticket operations
- `user.agent` - For user lookups (if needed)
- `organization.agent` - For organization data (if needed)
- `knowledge_base.reader` - Only for the Knowledge Base tools and resources (if needed). It grants read access to
  internal (unpublished) answers, not only public ones. Restrict the token's role per category in the Knowledge Base
  permissions so it reads only the categories it needs.
- `admin.tag` - Only for `zammad_list_tags`, which lists every tag in the system (if needed). It is an admin
  permission: it also grants **Manage > Tags**, where the token can add and delete tags and change whether agents may
  create tags. Grant it only when the tag listing is required.

The Zammad [permissions reference](https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/manage/roles/permissions.html) describes
each permission.

Avoid granting admin permissions unless absolutely necessary.

## Incident Response

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Scanning Tools

This project employs multiple layers of security scanning:

#### Static Analysis

- ✅ **Bandit**: Identifies common security issues in Python code (active in CI)
- **CodeQL**: GitHub code scanning setting. The repository contains no CodeQL workflow, so the repository
  security settings show its current state.
- **Codacy**: Not a CI scan. The tests workflow uploads coverage to Codacy only if you configure
  `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN`. PR #369 removed the no-op Codacy SARIF workflow.
- ✅ **Semgrep**: Pattern-based vulnerability detection (active in pre-commit and local quality checks)

#### Dependency Scanning

- ✅ **Dependabot**: Security alerts; automated version-update pull requests are disabled in repository configuration
- ✅ **pip-audit**: Python package vulnerability detection (active in CI)
- ✅ **Renovate**: Automated dependency management governed by the shared preset

Safety was removed because it introduced NLTK with an unpatched vulnerability
([GHSA-8mgp-746c-j5xp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8mgp-746c-j5xp)).
The blocking pip-audit scan covers the installed application and development dependencies
locally and in CI, without advisory exclusions.

#### Container Security

- ⏳ **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning (integration pending)
- ⏳ **Docker Scout**: Supply chain security analysis (integration pending)
- ⏳ **Hadolint**: Dockerfile best practices (integration pending)

### Running Security Scans Locally

```bash
# Run all security checks
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# Individual security scans
uv run pip-audit               # Check for vulnerable packages
uv run bandit -r mcp_zammad    # Static security analysis
prek run semgrep --all-files   # Pattern-based scanning

# Docker image scanning
docker scout cves ghcr.io/basher83/zammad-mcp:latest
```

## GitHub Actions Security

### Required Secrets

The security scanning workflow (`security-scan.yml`) needs no repository secrets beyond `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- **`CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN`**: Optional. It only enables the coverage upload step in the tests workflow
  (`tests.yml`). The security scanning workflow does not use it.
  - Available from your Codacy project settings

### Security Workflow

The repository includes automated security scanning that runs on:

- Every push to main branch
- All pull requests
- Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 09:00 UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks for local security checks:

```bash
# Install hooks
mise run hooks-install

# Run manually
mise run pre-commit-run
```

The hook definitions live in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml). The security-relevant hook ids
are `bandit`, `semgrep`, and `pip-audit`. `mise run hooks-install` also installs the Infisical secret-scan hook.

Installed hooks run on commits made through Git normally. They can be bypassed explicitly, so CI and branch protection
remain the authoritative enforcement boundary.

## CVE Process

### CVE Assignment

For qualifying vulnerabilities, we will:

1. Request CVE assignment through GitHub Security Advisories
2. Coordinate with reporter on CVE details
3. Include CVE in release notes and advisories
4. Update this document with CVE references

### Severity Scoring

We use CVSS v3.1 for vulnerability scoring:

- **Critical** (9.0-10.0): Remote code execution, authentication bypass
- **High** (7.0-8.9): Privilege escalation, data exposure
- **Medium** (4.0-6.9): Cross-site scripting, denial of service
- **Low** (0.1-3.9): Information disclosure, minor issues
